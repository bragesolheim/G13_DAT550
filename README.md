# G13: Stock market analysis: Finding the seasonality and trend

There are 2 primary jupyter notebooks in this assignment. These are `non_seasonal_stock.ipynb` and `seasonal_stock.ipynb`. These include preprocessing, Adfuller tests, pacf and acf, model fitting and prediction plotting.
Other important code is `Sarimax.ipynb`, where a function is created to bruteforece the best possible parameters for seasonal ARIMA. This is not used explicitly in this project, but was used to verify and give indication of correct path when working with analysis to find the best SARIMA model parameters.
